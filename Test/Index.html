          Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of
          websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web
          programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
          application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

          Web development, also known as website development, refers to the
          tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and
          web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also
          include web design, web programming, and database management. Web
          development is closely related to the job of designing the features
          and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is
          usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is
          to say, the programming of sites). The basic tools involved in web
          development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
          Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are,
          however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the
          construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from
          scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS)
          fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3,
          and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.
