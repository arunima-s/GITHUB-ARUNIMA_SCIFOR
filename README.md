# HTML Basics

This project introduces the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is used to create and structure webpages. Below are some key topics covered:

### 1. **What is HTML?**
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**, which is the standard language used to create webpages. It consists of various **HTML tags** and **attributes** that define the structure and formatting of web content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more.

### 2. **Common HTML Tags:**
HTML tags define the different elements of a webpage. Some of the commonly used tags include:
- `<html></html>` - The root of an HTML document.
- `<table></table>` - Defines a table.
- `<form></form>` - Creates a form for user input.
- `<span></span>` - Used for grouping inline-elements.
- `<ul></ul>` - Creates an unordered list.
- `<p></p>` - Defines a paragraph.
- `<head></head>` - Contains meta information about the document.
- `<div></div>` - Defines a division or section in a document.
- `<h1></h1>` - Represents the largest heading.

### 3. **Sample HTML Webpage:**
Below is a simple HTML program to create a webpage:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Test-1</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
</body>
</html>
